Quantinuum QAOA Challange 1
> This QAOA (quantum approximate optimization algorithm) implementaion uses the most naive possible classical optimisation strategy. Parameters are sampled from a uniform distribution and if a list of parameters increases the value of the cost function these values are stored as the best guess so far. Can you improve on this using a more sophisticated optimization strategy? COBAYLA and SPSA are two possible methods.
